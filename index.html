            <h2>My Journey To Japan</h2>
            <p>
               Ever thought about exploring a foreign land that is nothing like your own 
               and taking a solo trip there? One of the biggests goals I've ever achieved 
               was taking a 4 week solo trip to Japan. Japan has always been a fascinating 
               country to me. Ever since being exposed to Japanese cuisine, entertainment, 
               and culture, I wanted to learn more about Japan. With the technology that 
               we have today, watching YouTube videos or reading a book about Japan in 
               your home country can only go so far. I wanted a deeper experience. Of 
               course I did visit Japan when I was a child. In fact, I can still remember 
               that unique city scent that Yokohama, Japan had and a few vivid images in 
               my childhood memory. Everything else was fuzzy and I don't remember too 
               clearly.

            <h3>Making That First Step</h3>
            <p>
               For a very long time, I knew I wanted to visit Japan in either Spring
               or Autumn but nothing was going to happen if I kept dreaming about those 
               experiences. I had to make moves. In the Spring of year 2018, I finally 
               made my flight reservation to visit Japan from mid-October to 
               mid-November. Only 6 months to make preperations until lift off!

            <p>
               My departure flight from Atlanta to Chicago was delayed due to bad weather 
               and congested air traffic. This caused me to lose a day, resulting only 
               one day stay in Nagoya.

            <p>
               Kyoto, Japan is a large metropolitan area filled with rich culture and history. 
               The city is relatively flat and has many preserverd temples. I recommend renting 
               a bike if you're going to be sight seeing all day.

            <h3>Fukuoka, Japan</h3>
            <p>
               This is the second largest port city in all of Japan. I was able to identify 
               the different dialects compared to the other cities I visited. This city does 
               have a big shopping district called Canal City with a different variety of 
               consumer goods: appearal, food, entertainment, and etc. Some times a free live 
               performance will be displayed to the public at night. This city is also known 
               to have great street food near the Canal Shopping district. If you need a quick 
               bite to eat and a nice drink before heading into Canal City, check out the stret 
               food vendors.

            <h3>Riding the Tokaido Shinkansen to Fukui, Japan</h3>
            <p>
               Unlike drive a car or riding the subway train to get to your 
               destination, the Shinkansen (also know as the bullet train) can 
               travel fast. I mean really fast. Almost 285 km/h. Japan is known 
               for their quality of life of convenience and this is the way to go 
               when traveling long distances on train. Riding the Shinkansen can 
               allow to to view unique sceneries.

            <h3>Fukui, Japan</h3>
            <p>
               I arrived in Fukui, Japan shortly after riding the Tokaido Shinkansen. 
               I only spent about two days in the area and there wasn't much to see 
               when it comes to touristy attractions. However, I did find a place to 
               explore called Oshima. Oshima is a small coastal town and there you can 
               cross Oshima Bridge to reach the an island.

            <h2>Summarizing the rest of my trip.</h2>
            <p>
               Unfortunitely, the footage I took for the rest of this trip was 
               lost. So I will briefly summarize the remainder of my journey. 
               After spending a short time in Fukui, Japan my next destination 
               was Takayama in the mountains of Gifu Prefecture of Japan.

            <h3>Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, Japan</h3>
            <p>
               Takayama is a small town with preserved homes dating back in the Edo 
               Period. I was lucky to reserve a few nights in one of the traditional homes. 
               The timber construction was interesting to see but it got very cold 
               at night. Best to be prepared for colder weather. The air quality was 
               so clean, crisp, and unbelievebly refreshing. If you need a break from 
               the city life, I recommend taking a trip here.

            <h3>Enoshima, Japan</h3>
            <p>
               Enoshima is located south of Yokohama, Japan. Enoshima is a island 
               off the Sh≈çnan coast. If you like seafood, this is the place to be. 
               From squid, octopus, and other fish you've never heard of, you can 
               also get ice cream that have some unusually flavors. One option you 
               can get for ice cream is squid ink flavor. Pretty exotic eh? You 
               can also spend the whole day exploring the island itself; including 
               Enoshima Iwaya Cave.

            <h3>Yokohama, Japan and Tokyo, Japan</h3>
            <p>
               For the remainder of my trip, I visited my aunt and uncle who live 
               in Yokohama. My cousins also arrived from South Korea too. When I 
               explored the city with them, I had flash backs of my childhood 
               memories with them. Just like the flash back scenes you see in 
               movies or tv series. We explored the local neighborhood, Yokohama 
               Chinatown, and Akihabara, Tokyo.
